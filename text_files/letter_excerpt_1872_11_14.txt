We are under great obligation to you for the pleasure we have enjoyed ourselves during our stay with you; the only regret we feel that we could not stay a little longer. Since I came back I have been revolving something in my mind by which I think I can do something for Hamilton College, if you think it can be done. I am not acquainted with the financial state of the college, but from what little I have heard it is not very flourishing. You told me to write out my lectures and appear before the public. Now it strikes me, if I could prepare these lectures to please the public I will devote the proceeds to the establishing of a Scientific department in the institution. There must be a tact in the Manoevre of this enterprise, the details of which I will give if it is favorably looked upon by you & others of the Falculty [sic] when I will run to Utica & confer with you. I herewith inclose the photos of the members of my family. I trust you had a very good & interesting meeting with thte Alumni in Buffalo. Willie is constantly talking of College Hill & you. It is a great epoch in his life. We got home all safe & found the rest of my children very well. With unremitting Kind regards both to misses North & yourself
