I am very sorry you have given yourself so much trouble in writing five times to Albany I suppose, + then receive no answer. I shall go to Watertown after I finished Clinton + Utica. I have promised Rev. Mr Keyes to pay him a visit + speak to the church where he attends next Sunday. So it is just as well I do not lecture in Albany. You will find me + my daughters at Mr. Bradford S. Merrell’s any time on Tuesday if you chose to call for us. I should prefer going to Clinton in the 3:30 p.m. train. I send you herewith one box of tea per the “Merchants’ Express” freight already paid. We are all improving. Love from us all to you all. Till we meet I bid you good by
