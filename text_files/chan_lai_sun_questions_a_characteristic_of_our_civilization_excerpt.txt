On Monday afternoon, as I was taking my usual walk up State Street, when nearly midway of the sidewalk belonging to the armory grounds, a fellow with another man in a sleigh was riding down the hill, saw me walking, and without the least provocation, sing out, “See that d-d Chinaman,” And then he finished off with “Can ma-Kee?” addressing me. I stood there, perfectly astounded at this strange way of salutation, and followed him with my eyes as he rode away. I looked around to see if there were any policeman, to get him to give me an introduction to the braggadocio, but could see none. May I venture to ask you, sir, as a public teacher, what punishment does the law of your country inflict upon such person, who uses abusive language without provocation, at the representative of a foreign government? In my country –  China –  we hold such men as sacred, and if any abuse of whatever nature be practiced on them by any of our subjects, he is flogged within an inch of his life, and then is obliged to carry a piece of board on his shoulder called the Cangue, and exposed to public view. It may be that this is not your mode of punishment for such crime; but probably you will be pleased to inform the fellow, who may read your wide-circulated paper, the penalty of his salutation if ever I put him through a course of sprouts. I am, sir, yours, A STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.
