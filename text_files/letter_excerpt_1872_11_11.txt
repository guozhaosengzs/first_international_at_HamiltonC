I am in receipt of a circular inviting my presence The Tifft House, in the city of Buffalo on the 14th of November on business of great importance to the Institution. I would heartily respond to this invitation had I not such a large family to look after + care for. Probably you may be shocked, if I were to tell you that I have 33 sons and 3 daughters in this country. For fear they may get into trouble, I am obliged to keep a constant watch over them. And besides there are so many much more able sons of Hamilton College to transact business than one who is just arrived from China I trust you will have me excused with the greatest esteem
