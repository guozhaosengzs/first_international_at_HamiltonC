Yours dated the 21st inst: with two catalogues, one the Rural School & the other the Triennial have been duly received. & for which place accept my thanks. At present I have no boys to send to the school you recommend so highly. My two sons I am anxious to have them by my side. Of the second instalment of boys, we may think proper to send a couple to Clinton. They will be here sometime next summer. My other colleagues seem to be averse to send boys away from any of the New England States. However I can not do any thing this time as we have no boys to send. After my tour I have been on my back with the dysentery, but I feel much better today. If I keep on improving, I may start for Clinton either on Friday or Saturday the 1st or 2nd proximo [=next month] in which case I will telegraph. As I am so uncertain in my movements, you must not build much hope on my promise. Will you please tell me where your brother Josiah is, and all about him, or I had better hear of him when I see you at the end of this week. My two sons are getting along very well in their studies & will most likely be ready to enter college in less than three years preparation. We have had very dismal weather for three or four days past, in consequence of which I have not ventured to drive out on account of my health. The other members of my family seem to thrive in this new country. Hoping soon to have the pleasure of seeing your face,
