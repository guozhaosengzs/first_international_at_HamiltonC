Yours dated the 13th inst: is to hand. I have decided to give before the Stone Church Audience a lecture on the “Manners & customs of the Chinese” as I first proposed. I have also written to Dr Hudson to that effect. If I have the chance of speaking in Albany I will there give them a slight dose of the opium. In Utica I will speak of Chinese Education. By the way, if I lecture on opium I should like very much to have the notice given in the papers of the place in which I am to lecture, several days before hand. So that I may have newspaper reporters note what I say in their papers. On account of Willie’s illness I did not dare to leave home for Washington; but now he is much better, I trust I shall be able to leave sometime next week. Mrs Laisun has been attacked with a very severe cold & was confined in bed for one whole week. She is now better, and able to come to the table. I am extremely obliged to you for your forethought in making provisions for our visit. My daughter will stay with the Misses North and I will put up in the village. We all look forward with great deal of pleasure when we bring you our respects in February. I gave to the Springfield people at their urgent request, a dilution of “tea” the strong taste of which gives a “flagrant flavor to their tongue.” as you will see by the paper I herewith send you. With love from us all to you all
