The warm and hearty welcome to Clinton, with which you have extended to me, calls for thanks & acknowledgement on my part. Your much esteemed favor dated the 7th inst. greeted my eyes on my return from a tour of inspection of the boys placed under my charge in this country. The Chinese government has determined to send 120 pupils to be educated in this country in the arts and sciences. These boys are to be sent in four installments of 30 each year. They are selected from a preparatory school established by the government in Shanghai. The limit of their stay in the United States, in order to obtain their profession, is fifteen years. But if they can do it sooner, so much the better. From all the accounts of teachers under whom these boys have been placed, the unanimous opinion, is, that they are bright and clever youths, obedient and very studious. For the first two or three years they will simply learn the rudiments of the English language. I have two sons attending the school in this place. They will enter the high school by next quarter. I am greatly indebted to you for the catalogue of Hamilton College sent to me by you both here & China & also news papers. I am too busy at present to leave my post, but I have made up my mind to visit Clinton next Commencement with my whole family of 3 sons and 3 daughters and Mrs Laisun. I may attend the Junior Exhibition, but I can not promise I see by the catalogue that yourself and Professor Charles Avery are the only gentlemen I know. I long to see you & talk of old time, but that pleasure must be reserved for the future. My family joins me in very kind regards to you and all yours.
