It looks peculiar for one of another nation, dressed in another costume, to speak before an intelligent audience like this like this in an intelligent manner. It is twenty five years since I have been in this country; so if I seem rather rusty in my English, and make some mistakes, you will attribute it to rustiness and not to want of ability. What are we here tonight for? For education!  It is education among the people that elevates a nation. I am not going to give you an eloquent address tonight on this subject; but I will endeavor to compare our system of education with yours. Our system is a general one, as is yours. The Chinaman that can afford it will send his boy to school; and no matter how poor he may be, he can, if he is competent, reach the chair of the prime minister. It is not confined to any particular class, but is free and common to all. The same system that existed there 8000 years ago exists today. Every town in China has its school, every city its high school, and each province its university. Our system is as democratic as yours. Yours is producing the greatest result. Why, education fairly makes my hair stand! Where is the nation highly educated that is not highly civilized? Look at the United States, at England Prussia. We have a saying in China, “This day the flower blooms, and behold it is another year.” Your career is just begun. Whatever your future destiny may be, do your best!
