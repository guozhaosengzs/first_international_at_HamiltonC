Monsoon Bartlet wish me to thank you for the kind involution for last Fridays little park gathering which they regret they could not attend; they join me in hearty wishes for a happy new year for you and your family.
I must take this opportunity to thank J. Gallandt for the memoirs of his father which I read with deep interest.
