I have read yours of the 25th and 26th ulto: I am glad that I find much sympathy from you in the object I wish to accomplish. If Dr Hudson will write to me requesting my assistance to get a new library for the Stone Church Sabbath School, I will give a trial to my ability, whether I can hope for greater enterprise. At present it is useless to count the chickens before they are hatched. When we get the funds we shall be able then to tell to what purpose it shall be appropriated. I do not know as yet I shall be able to go to Washington before New Year. I may possibly go to New York. I have nearly finished my discourse on the division of professions. It is hard to get my mind together to write a lecture as I am entirely unaccustomed to anything of the kind. If I succeed in doing any good it would be mainly owing to the good cause, rather than to any “spicy sentences” that I may try to rake up. I note your words, “To lecture well is an art to be studied.” Yes, study I will, I am determined to give what I have of China for the benefit of Hamilton College. Through painful & constant study. Dr Hudson has not written to me yet. Perhaps we had better wait till the college vacation is over & then lecture, which will suit me the better because it will give me more time to practice on the art. But suit your convenience I shall be ready in a few days. Please make our kind remembrance to all your family
