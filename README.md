# Text Analysis of Chan Laisun and Yung Wing's Work
This is a Digital Humanities project that seeks to explore the writings of Chan Laisun (曾兰生) and Yung Wing (容闳), two Chinese students that first entered higher education institutions in the United States of America. Chan Laisun entered Hamilton College in 1846, studied for 2 years, and had to return to China because of lack of fouding, while Yung Wing graduated from Yale College in 1854. These two pioneers' path crossed again when Chinese Educational Mission (CEM) was established and Qing government decided to send young students to systematically learn in a western setting. Both Chan Laisun ann Yung Wing was part of the CEM, from selecting students back in China to accompanying and guiding them during their time in the U.S. The CEM was in the end called off and students were recalled, but they had enough education (from secondary school all the way to college, some did not complete their Bachelor's) to contributions to the modernization in China.
